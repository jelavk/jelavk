<p> For as long as I can remember I have been amazed by computers and what power lies beneath the hardware.
From jumping around dark web and reading forums, to actually learning computer science, the journey has 
stayed rewarding and motivating. 
 
My interests tend to be diverse yet some things are constant. I'm attracted to detail, (getting things in)
order and turning thought into code. I love logic, thinking and writing. I'm analytical, neat and precise
and that's exactly what made me fall in love with programming. 
Fascinated by the power of data, and by the many books read on the topic, I was more than thrilled
when I realized I can combine two things I love most, coding and analyzing.  

I am currently reading alot on the topic of BI (Business Intelligence), databases and data science / engineering.
Feel free to suggest talks, books or podcasts.</p>

<p>By no means am I an expert in these technologies, but I am most definitely striving to be one. I am 
currently following the OSSU curriculum to gain deep and fundamental knowledge of Computer Science. As well
as that, I'm acquiring a B.Sc in Mechanical Engineering and plan on getting my M.Sc in Data Science.</p>
